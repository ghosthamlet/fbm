RAND-SEED:  Specify a random number seed.  

Usage:

    rand_seed log-file seed

or:

    rand_seed log-file

Writes a random number generator state structure derived from the
specified seed to the given log file (which must already exist and be
non-empty), in a record with type 'r' and index equal to that of the
last existing record.

If invoked with just a log file as argument, the program prints the
random number seed from the state stored in the log file with index -1.  
(Note, however, that the random number seed in use may have been
changed by a later call of rand-seed, after some iterations have been
written to the log file.)

When rand_seed is not called, programs generally default to a seed of 1.
