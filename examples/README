This directory contains data files, command files, and generation
programs for the examples of Bayesian learning in the manual.  To play
with the data as in the manual, all you need to use are the data and
command files (eg, rdata and rcmds.net).  If you want to change the
way the data was generated, you'll need to recompile the programs,
which is done with a command such as the following:

   cc rgen.c rand.c -DRAND_FILE=\"../util/randfile\" -lm -o rgen
