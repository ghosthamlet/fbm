NET-PLT:  Get quantities from net log files, in a form suitable to plot.

The net-plt program is a specialization of xxx-plt to the neural network 
application.  It is capable of plotting any of the quantities documented 
in net-quantities.doc, mc-quantities.doc, and quantities.doc.

The form of the net-plt command is 

    net-plt x-axis y-axis { log-file [ range ] } 
            [ / test-inputs [ test-targets ] ]

The optional arguments at the end allow the quantities relating to test
cases to be evaluated with respect to a test set other than the one
specified with data-spec.

For the generic features of net-plt, see xxx-plt.doc.
