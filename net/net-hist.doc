NET-HIST:  Build a histogram for a quantity obtained from net log files.

The net-hist program is a specialization of xxx-hist to the neural
network application.  It can access any of the quantities documented
in net-quantities.doc, mc-quantities.doc, and quantities.doc.

The form of the net-hist command is 

    net-hist quantities low high bins { log-file [ range ] }
             [ / test-inputs [ test-targets ] ]

The optional arguments at the end allow the quantities relating to test
cases to be evaluated with respect to a test set other than the one
specified with data-spec.

For the generic features of net-hist, see xxx-hist.doc.
