SRC-GEN:  Generate randomly from the prior for a source location model.

Src-gen writes a series of independently-generated values for the
parameters of a source location model to a log file.

Usage:

    src-gen log-file [ max-index ]

Records containing parameters with indexes from zero up to the
indicated index are generated (the default is max-index of zero).  If
the log file already contains records with some of these indexes, only
records with indexes greater than the last existing record are
generated.

The parameters are generated randomly from the prior, using the random
number seed taken from the log file (eg, as specified by rand-seed).
If the detector and flow models contain any unknown parameters, values
for them are generated, as well as values for the source parameters.
