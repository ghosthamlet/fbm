SRC-INTENSITY:  Make predictions for source intensity in grid cells.

NOTE: THIS PROGRAM IS NOT IMPLEMENTED YET.

Src-intensity makes predictions for the total intensity of sources
within each cell in a grid.

Usage:

    src-intensity n-x [ n-y [ n-z [ n-t ] ] ] / { log-file range }

The initial arguments are the grid dimensions for x, y, z, and t
coordinates.  The value for the t dimension must be absent for steady
state models, or when there is no maximum stop time.  These arguments
default to one.  The total number of grid cells is the product of
these arguments.

After a "/", the remaining arguments come in pairs consisting of a log
file name and a range of iterations to use from that log file.  A
range is of the form "[low][:[high]][%mod]" or "[low][:[high]]+num".
When just "low" is given, only that index is used.  If the colon is
included, but "high" is not, the range extends to the highest index in
the log file.  The "mod" form allows iterations to be selected whose
numbers are multiples of "mod", with the default being "mod" of one.
The "num" form allows the total number of iterations used to be
specified; they are distributed as evenly as possible within the
specified range.  Note that it is possible that the number of
iterations used in the end may not equal this number, if records with
some indexes are missing.

The predictions (posterior expected values) for the total intensity of
all source within each cell are written to standard output.  There is
one line of output for each cell, containing the predicted intensity
for the cell followed by the x, y, z, and t coordinates for the centre
of the cell, excep that coordinates are omitted if the corresponding
grid dimensions are not specified (and hence default to one).  For
non-steady-state models, a source that starts and/or stops within the
time range of a cell is counted as having an effective intensity that
is its intensity parameter times the fraction of time it is on within
that cell.
