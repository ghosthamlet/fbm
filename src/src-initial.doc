SRC-INITIAL:  Set initial values for parameters of a source location model.

Set the initial parameters of the source location model.  

The defaults if no initial parameters are set with src-initial or
randomly generated (see src-gen.doc) is for the initial intensities,
start times and stop times (if relevant) for all sources to be zero.
The source locations are set to the middle of the allowed range.  The
number of sources, the noise degrees of free, the noise width
parameter, and the wind speed (for the test flow model) are initially
set to their minimum values.

Usage:

    src-initial log-file { flow-parameter } / [ noise-width [ noise-df ] ]
                         { / Q x y z [ start [ stop ] ] }

Appends a record to the log file with index 0 that contains values for
the flow parameters as given (or defaulting), the noise width and
noise degrees of freedom as given (or defaulting), and zero or more
intensities, coordinates, and start and stop times for sources (for
any remaining sources, these parameters are zero).  The number of
sources is set to the number for which parameters were specified, or
to the minimum, if that is larger.

For the test flow model, the sole parameter is the wind speed; it
defaults to its minimum value.
