  FLEXIBLE BAYESIAN MODELLING SOFTWARE, VERSION OF 2004-11-10.

  This directory and its subdirectories contain software for flexible
  Bayesian learning of regression, classification, density, and other
  models, based on multilayer perceptron neural networks, Gaussian 
  processes, finite and countably infinite mixtures, and Dirichlet 
  diffusion trees.  These models are implemented using Markov chain 
  Monte Carlo methods.  Software that does Markov chain sampling for 
  distributions specified by simple formulas for the density or for the 
  prior and likelihood is also included.

  For more information, see the files in the 'doc' directory.   The
  file 'index.html' in 'doc' has links to all the documentation, which
  is easily perused with a web browser.  Note: You must access 'index.html' 
  in the 'doc' directory, not copy it somewhere else, since the links are 
  relative.
