  FLEXIBLE BAYESIAN MODELLING SOFTWARE, VERSION OF 1999-12-06

  This directory and its subdirectories contain software for flexible
  Bayesian learning of regression, classification, density, and other
  models, based on multilayer perceptron neural networks, Gaussian 
  processes, and finite and countably infinite mixtures.  These models
  are implemented using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods.  Software
  that does Markov chain sampling for distributions specified by
  simple formulas for the density or for the prior and likelihood is
  also included.

  For more information, see the files in the 'doc' directory.  The file
  'manual' has all the introductory documentation as one long ASCII
  text file.  If you have a Web browser, you're better off viewing 
  'index.html' in 'doc', which has links to all the documentation.
  (Note: You must access 'index.html' in this directory, not copy it
  somewhere else, since the links are relative.)
