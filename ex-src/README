This directory contains command files and R programs for the examples
of inference for locations of sources of atmospheric contamination.

The command files provided here are a bit more general than the
commands in the tutorial examples.  The following general command
files exist:

   gen-cmds   Generate data, similar to the commands in the example
   fit-cmds   Fit models to data, similar to the commands in the examples
   pred-cmds  Make predictions for a grid of locations, as in the examples

These command files take arguments, allowing them to be used more
generally than just reproducing the examples.  To reproduce all the
examples (plus some more things), you can run the 'mk-grids',
'mk-data', 'do-runs', and 'do-pred' command files, in that sequence.
After this, the 'plt-data.r' and 'plt-pred.r' scripts can be run in R
to produce plots.

The file 'gridA' has grid points for an example suggest by Eugene Yee.
The 'genA', 'runcA', and 'runvA' files have commands to generate data
for that grid, and fit model with fixed and varying numbers of sources.

The scripts in 'genss-cmds' and 'fitssc-cmds' so some simple tests of
a non-steady-state model in which sources start and stop.
