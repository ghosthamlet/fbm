This directory contains command and data files for the examples of
Bayesian inference using the facilities in the 'dist' module.  The
data for the linear regression problem is generated by the program
in "rgen.c", which is compiled with a command like

   cc rgen.c rand.c -DRAND_FILE=\"../util/randfile\" -lm -o rgen

You will have to do this only if you want change the way the data is
generated.
