This directory contains command files for the examples of Markov
sampling from simple distributions.  The command files match the
commands given in the documentation, except that for all but 'ncmds',
the stepsize to use is given as an argument to the command file.  Note
that the log files (other than 'nlog') also include the stepsize as
part of the name.
