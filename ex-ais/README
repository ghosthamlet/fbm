This directory contains command and data files for the tests reported
in my paper on "Annealed Importance Sampling".  The first set of
tests, on a Gaussian distribution and a mixture of two Gaussians, use
the files whose names start with "t".  A test of tempered transitions
is also included in this set.  The second set of tests, on linear
regression models with Gaussian and Cauchy priors, use the files whose
names start with "s".
