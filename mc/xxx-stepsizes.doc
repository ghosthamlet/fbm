XXX-STEPSIZES:  Display and evaluate stepsizes used for dynamics.

There is a version of this program for each 'mc' application (eg,
net-stepsizes).  These programs display the stepsizes selected by the
application-specific module linked with the 'mc' modules, along with
the "optimal" stepsizes that would be selected on the basis of the
second derivatives of the energy, which are computed by differences
using the application-specific procedure for computing the gradient of
the energy.

These programs are meant primarily for use in debugging, but they
might occasionally be useful in checking whether the heuristic choice
of stepsizes has worked well in a particular situation.

Usage:

    xxx-stepsizes log-file index [ delta ]
 
Here 'xxx' is a prefix identifying the particular incarnation of this
program.  The stepsizes are computed for the state stored with the
specified index in the log file.  If a delta is given, the stepsizes
that would be selected based on the second derivatives at that point
are also displayed, the second derivatives being found by differences
of first derivatives, using the given delta.

The 'dist' module uses a specialized stepsizes program that also
allows stepsizes to be set.  See dist-stepsizes.doc for details.
