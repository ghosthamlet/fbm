MC-REWEIGHT:  Copy part of a log file while changing iteration weights.

MC-reweight operates much like log-copy except that it also changes
the weights for iterations by altering the records of type 'i'.  This
allows the iterations to be changed so as to produce an importance
sampling estimate for some distribution other than the one originally
sampled, provided a program for computing the appropriate weights has
been written.

Usage:

   mc-reweight logfile-in range logfile-out < file-of-log-weights

Records with negative indexes or with indexes in the indicated range
are copied from logfile-in to a newly-created logfile-out, except that
records of type 'i', which record information on Monte Carlo
iterations, are altered by adding values read from standard input to
the log weights recorded in these records.  The range has the usual
[low][:[high]][%modulus] form, as described in parse_range in misc.c.
If high and the colon are omitted, high defaults to low.  If high is
omitted but the colon is present, the range extends to the end of the
file.
