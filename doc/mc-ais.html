MC-AIS:  Monitor annealed importance sampling (AIS) runs.

MC-ais reads logs files containing data from Annealed Importance
Sampling (AIS) runs, and produces various indicators of how well AIS
is performing.

Usage:

    mc-ais values { log-file [ range ] }

Reads data from the log files given, in the indicated ranges (default
is the whole files), and computes from this data various values for
each temperature in the tempering schedule, and writes them to
standard output.  The values computed are given by the first argument,
which should consist of one or more letters form the following list:

    I   index in tempering schedule
    i   inverse temperature at this index
    T   temperature at this index

    m   mean of the importance weights at this index
    M   log of the mean of the importance weights
    F   minus the log of the mean of the importance weights

    v   variance of the normalized importance weights at this index
    V   variance of the logs of the importance weights at this index
    W   log (1 + variance of the normalized importance weights at this index)
    a   adjusted sample size at this index

The values requested are written to standard output.  Each line of
output pertains to one index in the tempering schedule, and contains
the values for that index, in the order requested.

The mean of the importance weights converges to the ratio of the
normalizing constants for the distribution at the given index and for
the distribution at inverse temperature zero.  The normalized
importance weights are obtained by dividing by the mean weight.  The
adjusted sample size is the number of points for which data exists
divided by one plus the variance of the normalized importance weights.
It is a rough indicator of the effective size of the sample available
for computing expectations.  

If the distribution of the logs of the weights is Gaussian, maximum
sampling efficiency is achieved when the tempering schedule is such
that the variance of the log weights (V) goes up linearly with the
tempering index (I), ending at the value of about one, corresponding
to the variance for the normalized weights being e-1 (about 1.7).

The distribution of the log weights will not be Gaussian when there
are isolated modes, however, or when there are occasional very bad
runs.  Because of this, it may be better to monitoring W than V, as it
will not be affected by a few really bad runs.  (When the logs of the
weights are Gaussian, W and V should be the same.)  A general rule of
thumb is therefore to modify the tempering schedule so that the
command "mc-ais IW logfile" shows W increasing approximately linearly
with tempering index (I) up to a final value of about one.
