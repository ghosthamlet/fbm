XXX-GRAD-TEST:  Test the correctness of the energy gradient computations.

There is a version of this program for each 'mc' application (eg,
net-grad-test).  These programs are used to check the energy gradient
computed by the application-specific 'mc' module against that found by
taking differences using the straight energy computation procedure of
the same module.  

These programs are meant for debugging, not for ordinary use.

Usage:

    xxx-grad-test log-file index delta
 
Here 'xxx' is a prefix identifying the particular incarnation of this
program.  The gradient computation is tested at the point stored with
the specified index in the log file.  It is compared to the gradient
found using finite differences with the given difference value.  The
results are written to standard output.
