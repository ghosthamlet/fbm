Dear Radford,

It was a pleasure meeting you again in Valancia in early June and learning
about neural network and Gaussian process models.  Since then I've been
trying to use your software, and one of our students (Marcus Lee) has 
downloaded it to our machine.  Unfortunately, I'm getting a lot of
messages like the following:

[1]    Floating exception            gp-mc artif.gp 10 (core dumped)

even with your own examples.  I'm now trying to replicate these "problems"
on my account on the statistics department computer.  Is your software
readily available there, and, if so, what do I need to do to access it?

Thanks for your help,

Uli

Hmm... Could you tell me what sort of machine you're running things
on?  Do you know what sort of floating point arithmetic it does?  One
possibility is that it stops the program with a "Floating point
exception" whenever overflow occurs, which isn't the way most machines
do things now.  If so, perhaps this behaviour can be disabled somehow,
seeing as the IEEE standard says that one is supposed to be able to
continue after this.

All the programs are in /u/radford/fbm/bin on utstat.  They work for me.

I'm about to release a new version of the software (in a few days), so
it would be good to figure out what the problem is on your machine, so
that it can perhaps be fixed in this new release.
