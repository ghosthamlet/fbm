SRC-DGEN - Randomly generate detector measurements given source parameters.

The src-dgen program randomly samples from the distribution of the
training measurements given the source parameters (as well as the
parameters of the detector and flow models, if any).  This may be of
interest in itself, and can also be used as part of Geweke's procedure
for testing the correctness of Markov chain sampling methods (see
<A HREF="xxx-mc-test.html">xxx-mc-test.doc</A>).

Usage:

    src-dgen log-file [ index ] / [ inputs ] targets-file

Parameters are read from the record in the log file with the specified
index.  Detector measurements are then sampled from their distribution
as defined by these parameters, for the locations/times of measurement
as read from the inputs file.  These measurements are written to the
targets file, whose previous contents are overwritten.  The random
number seed used is that saved for the index specified.

The default if no inputs are specified is the file of inputs for
training cases as specified with data-spec.  The default if no index
is specified is the last index in the log file.  When the last index
is used by default, the random number state is appended to the file
after being updated during generation of the measurements.
