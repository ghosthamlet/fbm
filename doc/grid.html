GRID:  Output a grid of points.  

Grid is meant for use as a source of input in a 'numin' specification,
when one wants, for instance, to test the performance of a network at
a grid of points in the input space.

Usage:

    grid { low:high%mod }

Each argument gives the range and increment for one dimension of the
grid.  The grid in that dimension consists of all points that are
multiples of 'mod' and that lie between low and high, inclusive.  The
last dimension specified is the one that changes fastest.
