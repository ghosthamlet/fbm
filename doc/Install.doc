INSTALLING THE SOFTWARE

The software is distributed as a Unix tar archive.  To obtain the
files, create an empty directory and change to it, download the tar
archive for the desired version by anonymous ftp or via your Web
browser to a file of the form 'bnn.YYYY-MM-DD.tar', and then issue the
Unix command

    tar xf bnn.YYYY-MM-DD.tar

If you got the archive in compressed form, as 'bnn.YYYY-MM-DD.tar.Z',
you must use the command "uncompress bnn.YYYY-MM-DD.tar.Z" before
doing the above.  The following instructions cover what to do next for
the current version; you should read the old documentation if for some
reason you are installing an older version.

The tar command should create sub-directories 'util', 'mc', 'net',
'bvg', 'examples', and 'doc', and place a large number of files in
these sub-directories.  It should also place the file 'README' in the
current directory.  If all this seems to have worked, you can remove
the file 'bnn.YYYY-MM-DD.tar'.

The directory 'doc' contains links to all the documentation files.
The file 'manual' contains all the introductory documentation
(including this) as a simple text file; the same information is also
contained in several .doc files.  Other .doc files contain more
detailed information.  Files of the form release.YYYY-MM-DD.doc
contain information on current and past releases.  These may be of
interest if you are upgrading from an older version of the software.
You can read these text files directly, or if you have a Web browser,
you can access them via 'index.html', as described in Guide.doc.

You will probably be able to compile the programs as described below
without making having to change anything.  However, it is possible
that you will want to use a different C compiler, or set certain
compilation options, in which case you will need to modify the
'Makefile' and 'xxx.make' files in the various directories.  Also, the
'util' directory contains a file of 100,000 natural random bytes,
which are used in combination with pseudo-random numbers.  This file
is accessed by many of the programs, using a path name that by default
points into this 'util' directory.  If you plan on moving this file
elsewhere, you will need to change the compilation command for rand.c
at the end of 'util/util.make'.

Once you have made any required changes, you can compile the programs
by issuing the following commands

    cd util
    make
    cd ..

    cd mc
    make
    cd ..

    cd net
    make
    cd ..

    cd bvg
    make
    cd ..

The last three commands can be omitted if you have no interest in the
demonstration of sampling from a bivariate Gaussian distribution. Note
that common modules will be compiled over again for each directory
where they are used; this is intentional.

It is possible that these compilation commands will fail for some
reason, in which case you'll have to figure out what's wrong and fix
it.  Note that for the makes to work correctly, the programs MUST be
kept in separate 'util', 'mc', 'net', and 'bvg' sub-directories, with
these names.

Once the above make commands have been successful, you should put the
directories 'util', 'mc', 'net', and perhaps 'bvg' in your search
path.  How this is done depends on the shell program you are using;
consult a local expert if you don't know how.  Subsequent instructions
assume that this has been done.
