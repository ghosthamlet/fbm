DIST-INITIAL:  Specify initial state for Markov chain.

The start state for the Markov chain used to sample from the specified
distribution can be set with dist-initial.  The default if no state is
specified is all zeros.

Usage:

    dist-initial log-file { var=value }

Appends a record to the log file (with index one greater than that in
the last record) that contains values for the state variables as
specified.  Variables that are not mentioned are set to zero.
