NOTES ON THE VERSION OF 2019-??-??


Changes in this version:

1) A new 'slevel' MCMC operation has been added, which allows the
   uniform [0,1] value used for accept/reject decisions and setting of
   slice levels to be retained in the state, and updated by a method
   that leaves its distribution invariant, rather than always being
   sampled independently of previous values.

2) A new "Bernoulli" built-in distribution has been added for
   formulas, which may be generated from in dist-gen, etc.

3) A new 'set-temp' MCMC operation has been added, meant for testing
   and other fiddling around.


Bug fixes.

1) The first (windowed) form of the hybrid operation now accounts for
   the temperature as specified with xxx-mc (not the simulated
   tempering temperature) when selecting a state from the accept or
   reject window.

2) The second (theshold) form of the hybrid operation now records the
   energy difference for an accepted state (and for the final state if
   none accepted), and also pays attention to the temperature as
   specified with xxx-mc when setting the threshold for acceptance.

3) Slice sampling operations now account for the temperature as set in
   the xxx-mc command.

3) There are a few minor documentation fixes. 


Known bugs and other deficiencies.

1) The facility for plotting quantities using "plot" operations in xxx-mc
   doesn't always work for the first run of xxx-mc (before any
   iterations exist in the log file).  A work-around is to do a run of
   xxx-mc to produce just one iteration before attempting a run of
   xxx-mc that does any "plot" operations.

2) The CPU time features (eg, the "k" quantity) will not work correctly
   if a single iteration takes more than about 71 minutes.

3) The latent value update operations for Gaussian processes may recompute 
   the inverse covariance matrix even when an up-to-date version was 
   computed for the previous Monte Carlo operation.

4) Covariance matrices are stored in full, even though they are symmetric,
   which sometimes costs a factor of two in memory usage.

5) Giving net-pred several log files that have different network architectures
   doesn't work, but an error message is not always produced (the results may
   just be nonsense).

6) Some Markov chain updates for Dirichlet diffusion tree models in which 
   there is no data model (ie, no noise) are not implemented when some of 
   the data is missing.  An error message is produced in such cases.

7) The times given in the documentation for the examples are for a
   very old computer.  Typical current (2019) desktop computers will
   be at least 20 times faster.
