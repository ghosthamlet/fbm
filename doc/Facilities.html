FACILITIES PROVIDED BY THIS SOFTWARE

This software implements flexible Bayesian models for regression and
classification applications that are based on multilayer perceptron
neural networks or on Gaussian processes.  The implementation uses
Markov chain Monte Carlo methods.  Software modules that support
Markov chain sampling are included in the distribution, and may be
useful in other applications.  Note that I am distributing this
software to facilitate research in this area.  Potential users should
make note of the copyright notice at the beginning of this document
(or accessible via the first hypertext link).  You must obtain
permission from me before using this software for purposes other than
research or education.  You should also note that the software may
have bugs, particularly regarding recently added experimental features.

The neural network models are described in my thesis, "Bayesian
Learning for Neural Networks", which has now been published by
Springer-Verlag (ISBN 0-387-94724-8).  The neural network models
implemented are essentially as described in the Appendix of this book.
The Gaussian process models are in many ways analogous to the network
models.  The Gaussian process models implemented in this software, and
computatonal methods that used, are described in my technical report
entitled "Monte Carlo implementation of Gaussian process models for
Bayesian regression and classification", available in compressed
Postscript at URL http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~radford/mc-gp.ps.Z.  The
Gaussian process models for regression are similar to those evaluated
by Carl Rasmussen in his thesis, "Evaluation of Gaussian Processes and
other Methods for Non-Linear Regression", available from his home
page, at the URL http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~carl/; he also talks about
neural network models.  To understand how to use this software, it is
essential for you to have read at least one of these references.

The neural network software supports Bayesian learning for regression
problems, classification problems, and survival analysis (experimental), 
using models based on networks with any number of hidden layers, with
a wide variety of prior distributions for network parameters and
hyperparameters.  The Gaussian process software supports regression
and classification models that are similar to neural network models
with an infinite number of hidden units, using Gaussian priors.

The advantages of Bayesian learning for both types of model include
the automatic determination of "regularization" hyperparameters,
without the need for a validation set, the avoidance of overfitting
when using large networks, and the quantification of uncertainty in
predictions.  The software implements the Automatic Relevance
Determination (ARD) approach to handling inputs that may turn out to
be irrelevant (developed with David MacKay).  

For problems and networks of moderate size (eg, 200 training cases, 10
inputs, 20 hidden units), fully training a neural network model (to
the point where one can be reasonably sure that the correct Bayesian
answer has been found) typically takes several hours to a day on our
SGI machine.  However, quite good results, competitive with other
methods, are often obtained after training for under an hour. The time
required to train the Gaussian process models depends a lot on the
number of training cases.  For 100 cases, these models may take only a
few minutes to train (again, to the point where one can be reasonably
sure that convergence to the correct answer has occurred).  For 1000
cases, however, training might well require a day of computation.

The software consists of a number of programs and modules.  Four major
components are included in this distribution, each with its own
directory:
  
    util    Modules and programs of general utility.

    mc      Modules and programs that support sampling using Markov 
            chain Monte Carlo methods, using modules from util.

    net     Modules and programs that implement Bayesian inference
            for models based on multilayer perceptrons, using the
            modules from util and mc.

    gp      Modules and programs that implement Bayesian inference
            for models based on Gaussian processes, using the modules
            from util and mc.

In addition, the 'bvg' directory contains modules and programs for
sampling from a bivariate Gaussian distribution, as a simple
demonstration of the capabilities of the Markov chain Monte Carlo
facilities.  Other than by providing this example, and the detailed
documentation on various commands, I have not attempted to document
how you might go about using the Markov chain Monte Carlo modules for
another application.

The 'examples' directory contains the data sets that are used in the
tutorial examples, along with shell scripts containing the commands
used.

It is possible to use this software to do learning and prediction
without any knowledge of how the programs are written (assuming that
the software can be installed as described below without any
problems).  However, the complete source code is included so that
researchers can modify the programs to try out their own ideas.

The software is written in ANSI C, and is meant to be run in a UNIX
environment.  Specifically, it was developed on an SGI machine running
IRIX Release 5.3.  It also seems to run OK on a SPARC machine running
SunOS 5, using the 'gcc' C compiler.  As far as I know, the software
does not depend on any peculiarities of these environments (except
perhaps for the use of the drand48 psuedo-random number generator),
but you may nevertheless have problems getting it to work in
substantially different environments, and I can offer little or no
assistance in this regard.  There is no dependence on any particular
graphics package or graphical user interface.  (The 'xxx-plt' programs
are designed to allow their output to be piped directly into the
'xgraph' plotting program, but other plotting programs can be used
instead, or the numbers can be examined directly.)
