ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

The revised sampling method for top-level hyperparameters that uses
adaptive rejection sampling, and the features allowing cpu time to be
stored, displayed, and used to control the number of iterations, are
based on work by Carl Edward Rasmussen.  Thanks also to David MacKay
and Chris Williams for testing the programs on their machines, and for
comments on the documentation.
