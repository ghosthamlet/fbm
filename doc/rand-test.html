RAND-TEST:  Test random number generators.  

Usage:

  rand-test seed generator { parameters } / sample-size [ low high bins ]

Using the seed given, tests the random number generator identified by
the second argument, for the parameter values specified.  The possible
generators and required parameters are as follows:

    uniform                  Uniform from [0,1)
    uniopen                  Uniform from (0,1)
    int n                    Uniform from the set { 0, 1, ..., (n-1) }
    gaussian                 From Gaussian with mean zero and unit variance
    exp                      From exponential with mean one
    cauchy                   From Cauchy centred at zero with unit width
    gamma alpha              From Gamma with shape parameter (and mean) alpha
    beta a b                 From Beta with parameters a and b

The size of the sample to use is also specified.  The program reports
the mean and variance of the sample.  A histogram is also printed if a
low and high range and number of bins are for it are specified.

These tests are not really adequate to detect subtle forms of bias due
to use of pseudo-random numbers, but are hopefully good enough to find
most programming errors.
