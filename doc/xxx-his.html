XXX-HIS:  Do Hamiltonian importance sampling.

There is a version of this program for each 'mc' application that
supports Hamiltonian importance sampling.  These programs implement an
importance sampling scheme in which states are randomly sampled from a
zero-temperature distribution (the prior, or a uniform distribution),
and then modified by applying Hamiltonian dynamics with momemtum
decay, with slice sampling reversals if necessary to take account of
the prior.  This produces a distribution over states which we hope is
close to the desired distribution, and which we can use to estimate
expectations with respect to the desired distribution by means of
importance sampling.

Usage:

    xxx-his log-file n-traj min-steps max-steps [ [-]modulus ]
                   / stepsize [ steps ] / inv-temp decay [ mix ]
 
Here 'xxx' is a prefix identifying the particular incarnation of this
program (eg, dist-his).

The log file must contain appropriate specifications for the model
before xxx-his is run.  One or more states, with appropriate weights,
are appended to this log file when each of n-traj trajectories are
simulated using the parameters specified after the two "/" arguments.
These states can be used to estimate expectations of various
quantities (eg, using dist-est), as well as the normalizing constant
for the distribution.  After xxx-his has finished, additional
trajectories can be simulated by simply running the program again.

The importance sampling distribution is an equal mixture of the
distributions defined by first sampling "position" coordinates from
the zero-temperature distribution and "momentum" coordinates from the
canonical distribution at inverse temperature inv-temp, and then
applying between min-steps and max-steps iterations of Hamiltonian
dynamics with momentum decay (perhaps slice sampling reversals to
account for the prior).  The inverse temperature may be specified
directly, or as "/T", where T is the temperature.

Conceptually, each trajectory simulated by xxx-his gives rise to
(max-steps - min-steps + 1) states from this importance sampling
distribution, produced by overlapping portions of the trajectory.
These states are written to the log file with appropriate importance
weights, unless modulus in specified, in which case only those whose
indexes (from 0) are multiples of modulus are written.  To find the
appropriate importance weights, the total probability of producing
each state under the importance sampling distribution must be found.
This involves a sum over all possible numbers of steps (from min-steps
to max-steps) that might have been used to produce the state.  Finding
this sum requires simulating a backwards portion of the trajectory for
(max-steps - min-steps) steps.  The states from this backward portion
of the trajectory, and from the portion before min-steps have been
done, are not saved in the log file, unless "-" is included before
modulus, in which case they are saved with weights that are
effectively zero (which works OK for estimating expectations, though
not for estimating normalizing constants).

Each iteration of the dynamics starts with the selection of a "slice"
level, uniformly distributed between zero and the prior density of the
current state (this is irrelevant if the prior is uniform).  This is
followed by steps (default 1) leapfrog updates, with stepsizes given
by the application's defaults times the given stepsize (or this
stepsize is used unaltered if it is preceeded by "-").  The prior
density of the resulting state is then calculated, and if it is less
than the slice level, the state is restored to what it was before the
leapfrog updates, and the momentum is negated.  Following this, the
momentum is multiplied by decay.  If a mix value is given, the
direction of the momentum is also altered at random by adding to each
component independent Gaussian noise with standard deviation equal to
mix times the norm of the momentum divided by the square root of the
dimensionality, and then rescaling so that the norm of the momentum is
unchanged.  These steps are reversed (with division by decay rather
than multiplication) when simulating backwards.

For good results, inv-temp should be chosen to be small enough that
the canonical distribution at this temperature is almost the same as
the prior (or almost uniform).  The range min-steps to max-steps
should be chosen so that the system cools to approximately a
temperature of one somewhere within this range of steps.  The stepsize
needs to be small enough that the dynamics is stable.  Finally, the
decay needs to be sufficienly slow (ie, the decay parameter needs to
be only slightly less than one) if the importance weights are not to
be highly variable.
