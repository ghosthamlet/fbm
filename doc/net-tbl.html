NET-TBL:  Get quantities from net log files and output as a table.

The net-tbl program is a specialization of xxx-tbl to the neural
network application.  It is capable of finding any of the quantities
documented in <A HREF="net-quantities.html">net-quantities.doc</A>, <A HREF="mc-quantities.html">mc-quantities.doc</A>, and <A HREF="quantities.html">quantities.doc</A>.

The form of the net-tbl command is 

    net-tbl [ -h ] quantities { log-file [ range ] } 
            [ / test-inputs [ test-targets ] ]

The optional arguments at the end allow the quantities relating to test
cases to be evaluated with respect to a test set other than the one
specified with data-spec.

For the generic features of net-tbl, see <A HREF="xxx-tbl.html">xxx-tbl.doc</A>.
