MOL-MC:  Do Markov chain sampling for a molecular system.

The mol-mc program is the specialization of xxx-mc to the task of
sampling from the canonical distribution for the states of a molecular
system.  See <A HREF="xxx-mc.html">xxx-mc.doc</A> for the generic features of this program.

The Markov chain state for the system consists of the coordinates of
all the molecules (with all coordinates for a molecule in consecutive
positions), scaled so their range is [0,1) - in other words, the
actual coordinates are obtained from those stored by multiplying by
the length of a dimension.  If the NPT ensemble is being used, the log
of the length of a dimension is stored as a final component of state.

The following applications-specific sampling procedures are implemented:

    wrap           

        Changes the position coordinates of all the molecules so that 
        they range from 0 to the length of a dimension, by adding the 
        appropriate integer multiple of this length.  Wrapping the 
        coordinates is generally not necessary, since they are wrapped 
        before being used in any case.  Occassional wrapping will prevent 
        them from wandering off to infinity, however, which could 
        eventually cause problems with roundoff error.

    met-mol [ stepsize ]

        Does Metropolis updates for the position of each molecule in 
        turn.  This is like the standard metropolis and met-1 operations
        (see <A HREF="mc-spec.html">mc-spec.doc</A>), except that all coordinates of one molecule 
        are updated simultaneously, by adding independent Gaussian noise
        with standard deviation given by the stepsize, and the result 
        is then accepted or rejected.  In contrast, metropolis updates
        all coordinates of all molecules at once, and met-1 updates 
        just one coordinate of one molecule at a time.  

    met-len [ stepsize ]

        Does a Metropolis update for the length of a dimension (actually,
        for the log of this length).  Only allowed when the NPT ensemble
        is being used.

The inverse temperature used in tempering methods is interpreted in
the standard way, as a power to raise the (unnormalized) probability
density to, or equivalently, a factor to multiply the energy by.

The default stepsizes for updating the coordinates (in their [0,1)
form) are all equal to N^{-1/D}, where width is the width parameter of
the potential, N is the number of molecules and D is the
dimensionality of the space.  This corresponds roughly to an
appropriate stepsize if the molecules are tightly packed.  The default
stepsize for the log of the length of a dimension (when using the NPT
ensemble) is 1/N.  These defaults are scaled during tempering and
annealed importance sampling by multiplying by the square root of the
temperature.

When using the NPT ensemble, the length of each dimension is
initialized so that the reduced density is 1/2.  The positions of the
molecules are initialized randomly, from the uniform distribution.
Momenta (if needed) are initialized from their canonical distribution
at (actual, not reduced) temperature one.
