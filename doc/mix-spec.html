MIX-SPEC:  Specify a mixture model, or display existing specification.

Mix-spec creates a log file containing the specifications for a
mixture model, along with the associated priors over hyperparameters.
When invoked with just a log file as an argument, it displays the
specifications for the mixture model stored in that log file.

Usage:

    mix-spec log-file N-inputs N-targets [ N-components ]
             / concentration SD-prior [ mean-prior ]

or:

    mix-spec log-file

N-inputs and N-targets are the numbers of input variables and target
variables in the model.  The model tries to represent the joint
distribution of the targets, using a mixture.  At present, the number
of inputs (N-inputs) must be 0, but in future, input variables may be
allowed, in which case the model will define the joint conditional
distributions for the target values given observed values for the
inputs.

N-components is the number of components in the mixture.  If it is
omitted, the number of components is countably infinite, giving the
effect of a Dirichlet process mixture.

The concentration argument specifies the concentration parameter for
the Dirichlet distribution for the component probabilities.  At
present, this must be fixed.  If the value starts with "x", the value
given is automatically scaled downward by the number of components.
The "x" must be present if the number of components is infinite (the
default), as this is the scaling needed for the finite model to reach
a sensible limit.

Each component of the mixture has associated with it a set of "offset"
parameters, one for each target value.  The offset of a binary target
will determine the probability of it being a "1"; the offset for a
real-valued target gives its mean.  The prior distribution of these
offsets is defined by top-level means and standard deviations for each
target value.  The top-level mean for each target is usually a
variable hyperparameter; these means are given independent Gaussian
priors with mean zero and standard deviation as specified by the
mean-prior argument of mix-spec.  If mean-prior is absent, all the
top-level means are set to zero.  The top-level standard deviations
for the offsets associated with the targets may be either fixed or
variable, as specified by the SD-prior argument of mix-spec, using the
general form of specification described in <A HREF="prior.html">prior.doc</A>.  If the SD-prior
argument starts with "x", it is automatically scaled according to the
number of target values, as described in <A HREF="prior.html">prior.doc</A>.

The specification of the model is completed using the model-spec
command (see <A HREF="model-spec.html">model-spec.doc</A>), which specifies whether the model is for
binary or real data.  For real data, it also specifies the prior for
the "noise" standard deviations, in a three-level hierarchical form,
which allows for a top-level standard deviation common to all target 
values and components, a standard deviation for each target value,
common to all components, and standard deviations for each target value 
for each component.

Note: There is no way at present of getting the prior for the means of
the offsets for the targets to have a mean other than zero, but you
can get an equivalent effect by transforming the target values by
subtracting a constant, as described in <A HREF="data-spec.html">data-spec.doc</A>.
