SRC-PRED:  Make predictions for measurements in test cases.

Src-pred makes predictions for the target values in test cases, which
are the concentration measurements at the locations/times specified by
the inputs for the test cases.  It can also compare these predictions
with the true values, if these have been provided.

Usage:

    src-pred options { log-file range } [ / test-inputs [ test-targets ] ]

The final optional arguments give the source of inputs and targets for
the cases to look at; they default to the test data specification in
the first log file given.  The source, flow, and noise parameters to
use for the predictions are taken from the records with the given
ranges of indexes in the given log files.  Mean predictions are
obtained by averaging the predictions from all these iterations.

An index range can have one of the forms "[low][:[high]][%mod]" or
"[low][:[high]]+num", or one of these forms preceded by "@".  When "@"
is present, "low" and "high" are given in terms of cpu time, otherwise
they are iteration numbers.  When just "low" is given, only that index
is used.  If the colon is included, but "high" is not, the range
extends to the highest index in the log file.  The "mod" form allows
iterations to be selected whose numbers are multiples of "mod", with
the default being "mod" of one.  The "num" form allows the total
number of iterations used to be specified; they are distributed as
evenly as possible within the specified range.  Note that it is
possible that the number of iterations used in the end may not equal
this number, if records with some indexes are missing.

The 'options' argument consists of one or more of the following letters:

    i   Display the input values for each case
    t   Display the target values for each case

    p   Display the log probability of the true targets (to base e)

    n   Display the guess based on the mean, and its squared error
    d   Display the guess based on the median, and its absolute error
    D   Display the guess based on the mean of the median for each iteration.
        Not really useful for src-pred.

    q   Display the 10% and 90% quantiles of the predictive distributions
        for the targets.  Note that these distributions include the noise.
    Q   Display the 1% and 99% quantiles of the predictive distributions.

    b   Suppress headings and averages - just bare numbers for each case.
        The numbers are printed in exponential format, to high precision.
    B   Bare numbers, but with blank lines whenever first input changes.

    a   Display only average log probabilities and errors, suppressing 
        the results for individual cases (makes sense only in combination 
        with one or more of 'p', 'n', and 'd', and not with 'i' or 't')

Tthe 'a' option is incompatible with 'b', 'i', 't', 'q', or 'Q', and
the 't', 'p', and 'a' options may be used only if the true targets are
given.  The errors for individual cases are also displayed only if the
true targets are known.  

The median and quantiles are calculated by Monte Carlo, using a sample
consisting of 101 points from the predictive distribution for each
Gaussian process.  A sample of 100 points for each Gaussian process is
used to calculate predictive probabilities for binary and class
models.  If the noise variance is not fixed, test-case variance is
chosen randomly for each iteration (this is a bit sub-optimal, as it
would be better to pick a new variance for each of the 101 points used
to compute the median - but the programming was easier this way).

These Monte Carlo estimates are found using a random number stream
initialized by setting the seed to one at the start of the program.
Accuracy can be increased by repeating the same log-file/range
combination several times, effectively increasing the sample size use.
Furthermore, the 'a' option is incompatible with 'b', 'i', 't', or
'q', and the 't', 'p', and 'a' options may be used only if the true
targets are given.  The errors for individual cases are also displayed
only if the true targets are known.

The median and quantiles are calculated by Monte Carlo, using a sample
consisting of 101 points from the predictive distribution for each
Gaussian process.  A sample of 100 points for each Gaussian process is
used to calculate predictive probabilities for binary and class
models.  If the model has case-by-case noise variances, a single
test-case variance is chosen randomly for each Gaussian process (this
is a bit sub-optimal, as it would be better to pick a new variance for
each of the 101 points used to compute the median, and to integrate
the variance away to produce a t-distribution when computing the log
predictive probability - but the programming was easier this way).

The 'D' option is implemented, but is of no real use, since models for
survival analysis aren't supported, and individual medians for other
models are the same as means.  It's here only because of net-pred.

Each average performance figure is accompanied by +- its standard
error (as long as there is more than one test case).

If only inputs and targets are to be displayed (no predictions), one
may give just a single log file with no range.  Otherwise, at least
one iteration must be specified.

Note that src-pred always considers there to be four inputs (x, y, z,
and t), even for steady-state models (where t is meaningless), and
when fewer inputs are specified in data-spec.
