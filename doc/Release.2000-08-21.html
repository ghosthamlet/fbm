NOTES ON THE VERSION OF 2000-08-21

Major features of this release:

  o Simulations can (sometimes) be done using "circular coupling", as
    described in my technical report on "Circularly-coupled Markov chain 
    sampling".  Implementing this required a number of changes and additions
    to the software.

  o New multivariate slice sampling procedures have been implemented, 
    described in my technical report on "Slice sampling" (a revision of
    the earlier report on "Markov chain Monte Carlo methods based on 
    `slicing' the density function").

  o A new example has been added of sampling from a "funnel" distribution,
    which demonstrates some problems with MCMC, and how slice sampling
    can help overcome these problems.

Various other less major changes have also been made.


Changes in this version:

1) A new xxx-circ command has been added (see <A HREF="xxx-circ.html">xxx-circ.doc</A>), which does a 
   circularly-coupled simulation to produce a wrapped-around chain.  Multiple 
   starting points are used in order to diagnose convergence problems.  The 
   simulation can be done sequentially or in parallel. 

2) A new xxx-wrap command has been added (see <A HREF="xxx-wrap.html">xxx-wrap.doc</A>), which does simple
   simple circularly-coupled simulations with just one starting point.  It 
   produces a wrapped-around chain starting from an existing log file for a 
   standard simulation.

3) Simple examples of circular coupling done using dist-wrap and dist-circ 
   have been added.  See <A HREF="Ex-circ.html">Ex-circ.doc</A>.

4) When acceptance decisions for Metropolis, hybrid Monte Carlo, and other
   Markov chain operations are made, the random number sometimes required
   is now ALWAYS generated, so as to keep the random number stream 
   synchronized for two runs with the same random seed but different 
   starting points.  Previously, this random number was not generated if
   the energy change was negative, since acceptance was then guaranteed
   regardless of the random number chosen, but this undermines coupling.

   Note that some Markov chain operations are still not appropriate for
   use in circularly-coupled simulations, including slice sampling operations
   and updates for second-level neural network hyperparameters.

   As a result of this change, redoing previous runs with the new version
   will typically produce different results, but the distribution sampled
   should be the same.

5) New "rgrid-met" and "rgrid-met-1" operations have been added, designed to 
   produce coalescence of coupled chains once they are close together.  
   See <A HREF="mc-spec.html">mc-spec.doc</A> for details.

6) A new xxx-genp program has been written that generates random momentum
   variables (see <A HREF="xxx-genp.html">xxx-genp.doc</A>).  Such a program is not normally required, 
   since momentum variables are generated automatically by xxx-mc if they 
   don't exist and are needed, but explicit generation is needed to ensure
   random number synchronization in xxx-circ. 

7) A new log-equal program has been added that tests whether or not the
   records stored at given indexes in given log files match exactly.  
   This was needed to write xxx-circ.  See <A HREF="log-equal.html">log-equal.doc</A> for details.

8) An option has been added to allow the indexes of records appended with
   log-append to start with a specified index or the last existing index, 
   rather than one past the last index.  This was needed to write xxx-circ.  
   See <A HREF="log-append.html">log-append.doc</A> for details.

9) Options have been added to log-copy and log-append to allow them to
   ignore records of certain types.  This is for consistency with the new
   log-equal command, and because it's needed for xxx-wrap.  For details,
   see <A HREF="log-append.html">log-append.doc</A> and <A HREF="log-copy.html">log-copy.doc</A>.

10) A "-b" option has been implemented for all the Metropolis updates, which
    causes acceptance decisions to be made with the "Barker" / "Boltzmann"
    function, rather than the usual Metropolis function.  This is so I could
    see if this makes a difference to coalescence speed when coupling.  See
    <A HREF="mc-spec.html">mc-spec.doc</A> for details.

11) A "-r" option has been implemented for all single-variable Metropolis
    and slice sampling updates, which causes just one randomly-chosen
    variable to be updated each iteration, rather than all of them.  See
    <A HREF="mc-spec.html">mc-spec.doc</A> for details.

12) When doing single-variable slice sampling with slice-1 or slice-over
    with max-steps set to 1, the random number for allocating steps to
    the left or right is no longer generated, as it has no effect when 
    max-steps is 1.  This will cause results of runs to differ in detail from 
    before, due to the subsequent random number sequence differing.

13) A "slice" and "slice-gaussian" operations that do multidimensional 
    slice sampling have been added.  See <A HREF="mc-spec.html">mc-spec.doc</A> and my new tech
    report on "Slice sampling".

14) A new example of sampling from a "funnel" distribute has been added,
    showing an interesting/disturbing problem, and how slice sampling can
    help avoid it.

15) The 'dist' module now allows specification of Bayesian models in which
    the entire likelihood function is given as a formula, with the data
    appearing in the formula as constants.  This is an alternative to
    the normal method of giving a formula for the likelihood due to one
    case, with the data for that case filled in from a data file.  See
    <A HREF="dist-spec.html">dist-spec.doc</A> for details.

16) The defaults for the get2 and opt2 trajectory computation methods 
    have been changed to "firstp" - ie, update the momentum first.  This
    is for consistence with the leapfrog method, and because this is
    sometimes better than "firstq".  

17) The number of iterations in the examples of sampling from the "ring"
    distribution in <A HREF="Ex-dist-g.html">Ex-dist-g.doc</A> has been increased to 2000, so that
    autocorrelations will be better estimated.  The new multivariate
    slice sampling operations are now included.


Bug fixes.

1) Fixed a bug in dist-est that caused the estimate for the standard error 
   of the mean to be wrong if the number of data points exceeded 46340.

2) Fixed a bug that affected use of trajectory computation methods other
   than the standard "leapfrog" for neural network models.

3) The 'formula' module, used by the 'dist' module, has been altered to
   allow it to compute the gradient of a*b and a/b when b is undefined
   but a and its gradient are both zero.


Known bugs and other deficiencies.

1) The facility for plotting quantities using "plot" operations in xxx-mc
   doesn't always work for the first run of xxx-mc (before any
   iterations exist in the log file).  A work-around is to do a run of
   xxx-mc to produce just one iteration before attempting a run of
   xxx-mc that does any "plot" operations.

2) The CPU time features (eg, the "k" quantity) will not work correctly
   if a single iteration takes more than about 71 minutes.

3) The latent value update operations for Gaussian processes may recompute 
   the inverse covariance matrix even when an up-to-date version was 
   computed for the previous Monte Carlo operation.

4) Covariance matrices are stored in full, even though they are symmetric,
   which sometimes costs a factor of two in memory usage.

5) The "p" option of net-pred isn't allowed for survival models with
   piecewise-constant hazard.  There's no big reason for this - I just
   haven't gotten around to it.
