BVG-PLT:  Get quantities from a bvg log file, in a form suitable to plot.

The plot program for bivariate Gaussian distributions is just the
generic plot module (for which, see <A HREF="xxx-plt.html">xxx-plt.doc</A>), with no new
quantities defined, except that an application argument of "ellipse"
may be specified, in which case a one-standard-deviation ellipse is
plotted for each log file.  Doing this makes sense only if the rest of
the plot is of the values for the two variables (q0 and q1).
